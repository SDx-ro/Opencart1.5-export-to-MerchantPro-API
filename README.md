📦 SDx Export to MerchantPro API

Module for OpenCart 1.5.x → MerchantPro API product synchronization

This tool provides a structured way to export/sync OpenCart 1.5.x product, category, attribute, and auxiliary data into MerchantPro (MP) using the MP API.

It is designed for a custom and modernized OpenCart 1.5.5 installation upgraded to PHP 8.3, with a legacy-preserved and customized jQuery 1.7 environment.

🚀 Features

Extracts data from OpenCart 1.5.x (products, categories, attributes, etc.)

Loads MerchantPro product data through API-provided XLSX feeds

Merges & consolidates the MP feeds into a unified product dataset

Generates a JSON cache file containing MP products

MP products with ext_ref (identifiable)

MP products without ext_ref (susceptible to deletion)

Provides admin-side UI for monitoring, triggering sync, and reviewing data

Stores API configuration using standard OC setting table mechanisms

Fully compatible with a heavily customized OC1.5 on PHP 8.3

📁 OpenCart Module Structure (Standard OC 1.5 Routing)

The module follows the classic OpenCart 1.5.x admin routing pattern:

admin/
├── controller/
│   └── tool/
│       └── sdx_export_to_mp_sync.php
├── language/
│   ├── english/
│   │   └── tool/
│   │       └── sdx_export_to_mp_sync.php
│   └── romana/
│       └── tool/
│           └── sdx_export_to_mp_sync.php
├── model/
│   └── tool/
│       └── sdx_export_to_mp_sync.php
└── view/
    └── template/
        └── tool/
            └── sdx_export_to_mp_sync.tpl

⚙️ MerchantPro API Configuration

MerchantPro API settings are stored using the native OC 1.5 setting table conventions.

// Load settings & derive store slug
$this->load->model('setting/setting');
$settings = $this->model_setting_setting->getSetting('sdx_export_to_mp_sync');

// Grouped API settings
$api = isset($settings['sdx_export_to_mp_sync_api']) 
    ? $settings['sdx_export_to_mp_sync_api'] 
    : array();

The $api settings array includes:
Key	Description
$api['mp_api_url']	MerchantPro API base URL (e.g., https://www.okled.ro
)
$api['mp_api_name']	Informational name for the connection
$api['mp_api_key']	API username
$api['mp_api_secret']	API password
$api['mp_feed_simple']	URL to XLSX feed for simple/variable products (no variants)
$api['mp_feed_variants']	URL to XLSX feed for product variants

Additionally:

sdx_export_to_mp_sync_module

Stored in the setting table (group sdx_export_to_mp_sync)

Represents whether MerchantPro sync is enabled

May be used as a feature toggle for additional future behaviors

📄 How the Module Works
1. Fetch XLSX Feeds from MerchantPro

Two MP-generated XLSX datasets are retrieved:

Simple + variable products feed

Variant products feed

2. Parse & Combine Data

The tool analyzes, merges, and normalizes both XLSX sources into one consolidated dataset.

3. Generate JSON Cache

A JSON cache file of MP products is created, splitting entries into:

Products with ext_ref → can be matched with OpenCart products

Products without ext_ref → unidentifiable, potentially removable or problematic

4. Sync / Export Logic

Handled within the controller and model:

Comparison between OC & MP datasets

Identification of new, updated, or removable MP products

Data mapped according to MP’s API requirements

Admin interface (.tpl) provides visualization & controls.

🏗️ Requirements

OpenCart 1.5.x (customized)

PHP 8.3 compatible environment
(This module assumes you are running a modernized OC1.5 with deprecated code already upgraded.)

cURL enabled

XLSX parsing library compatible with PHP 8.x
(depending on module implementation)

🔧 Installation

Upload the admin folder to your OpenCart installation:

your-store/admin/


Navigate to:

Admin → Tools → SDx Export to MerchantPro Sync


Configure MerchantPro API credentials:

API URL

API Name

API Key & Secret

XLSX feed links

Save settings — they are stored under:

setting.group = 'sdx_export_to_mp_sync'


Begin synchronization using the admin interface.

📌 Notes

This module interacts with MerchantPro exclusively through its official API endpoints.

It does not modify core OpenCart data unless explicitly implemented in controller/model logic.

The system is optimized for large product catalogs and repeated exports.
